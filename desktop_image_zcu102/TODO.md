# TODO list

 * to eliminate the bug at the beginning of the script (setting the Xilinx folder)
 * to add LICENSE (choosing the right one for our purpose)
 * to add Artico³ compatibility. Steps:
	- To modify script 10 with the .tar.
	- Uncomment lines in 11 to move related files.
 * add system compatibility with vivado 2017.4 and 2017.1. To do so:
	- add variable that is set up in 02 in order to select the commands in next scripts.
	- check zcu102 part version in .tcl, might execute the .tcl commands in order to check compatibility with actual 2018.1. 
	- check if bugfix-display-port patch is required in older versions.
	- in 05 is mandatory to use v2018.1, but pmu code generated by vivado should change!
	- in 06 check BOOTARGS definitions in defconfigs to delete them all. 
	- need new patch for the kernel.
	- repository for the mali might change, check arm website to see kernel compatibility and petalinux sources to change patches.
	- A lot of things that need to be tested at work.
	
Related with desktop bugs:
	
 * to create a bugfixes.sh script to solve:
    - The problem with the login screen after timeout activity (the screen goes black and you cannot login again) The solution is change .Xauthority permissions. 
    - The problem with netsurf web browser, need to be installed. You can add this to the bugfixes.sh or it is prefered to be added in the desktop_install.sh.
